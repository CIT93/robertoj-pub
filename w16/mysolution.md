# solution

I plan to create a separate if function for each appliance. My idea is to accumulate points by taking user input for each appliance and running two if functions to calculate and add the points. I'm still undecided on whether to use a dropdown menu or allow users to type numbers for the input. Thatâ€™s my plan so far.

## last problem

in the final challenege after doing some research i have found that using the method toString() allows us to return a string for the object.
