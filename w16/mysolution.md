# part 1

"my code for part 1" commit 

My approach was to separate dishwashers and washing machines since most people use a washing machine, but not everyone uses a dishwasher. also I chose to avoid using checkmarks because they can be challenging to work with. I learned this the hard way while working on my decision app.
